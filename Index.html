    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        I have many hobbies that occupy the time that i have to spare. Some of these include Longboarding, Rugby, Pc Gaming, tv and, movies. Below you can read a more descriptive reason and, favorite things about these hobbies.
    </p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longboarding" Title="Longboarding" target="_blank">Longboarding</a></h3>
        <p id="para2">
            There are many reason to why this is one of my favorite hobbies. I guess the most dominate one is it is just plain old good exercise especially when you get into the more technical aspect of it. Thesecond would most likely be it doesn't matter whether you are in a large group of people or just by yourself either way you will be able to get the same ammount of enjoyment. There are many types of boards for many different styles of riding. You have <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeride_(longboard)" title="Freeride" target="_blank">Freeride</a></strong> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_board"title="PennyBoard"target="_blank">PennyBoard</a> and, Finally we have <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/490506-shortboard-cruiser-vs-longboard-cruiser/"title="cruiser"target="_blank">cruiser</a>. There is not much else I can say other than just get out there and, try it for yourself you might find that you have found your next big way of enjoyment/exercise.

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football"title="Rugby"target="_blank">Rugby</a></h3>
    <p id="para1">
        Oh man there is some much I can say about the greastest sport to ever be invented where should I start? I guess we should start off by say like Longboarding Rugby is another great way to get exercise however be warned that this is a dangerous sport so players beware. That aside the reason I love this game so much is all the teammates I have had over the years. Your team becomes a second family to you you need to have alot of trust with them on and off the pitch(A pitch is what the rugby field is called if you didn't read the wiki). Additionally another great reason this is an awesome sport is the fact that it's so fast paced unlike football the only time that the play clock stop is for timeouts and, injuries which makes it easier to stay in the zone.

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game"title="PC Gaming"target="_blank">PC Gaming</a></h3>
    <p id="para3">
        This is my second favorite hobby I have just because I can kick back and, relax after a long day and, imurse myself into a new world that only exists on the screen ahead of me. Pc gaming is a great way to sit back and unwind due to there is no physical movements involved like with the two above hobbies. There is a huge amount of different genres you can choose from some of them include.  Of these few I have mentioned I would say my favorite is horror. I have played many horror titles over the years and, have yet to find a game that that has yet to not scare me. The only thing is that you have to spend a pretty penny inorder to play these games at settings that will appease your visual sense. I personally have spent $1500.00 on my current rig. I have seen people who spend upwards of $5000.00 which in my opinion is just ridiculous.
